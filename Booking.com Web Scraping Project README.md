Web Scraping Project: Hotel Data Retrieval from Booking.com

Description:

In this web scraping project, I developed a Python script to extract hotel data from Booking.com. The script utilizes the Requests library to send HTTP requests to the Booking.com website and the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML content of the response. With this script, I aimed to gather comprehensive information about hotels in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, including their names, locations, pricing, ratings, review counts, and thumbnails.

Key Features:

Data Extraction: The script extracts data from the Booking.com search results page, targeting specific HTML elements containing hotel information.

Dynamic Content Handling: Utilizing Beautiful Soup, the script navigates through the HTML content and extracts relevant data, including hotel names, locations, pricing, ratings, review counts, and thumbnails.

CSV Export: The extracted data is stored in a CSV file, providing a structured format for further analysis or integration with other applications.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language used for web scraping and data manipulation.

Requests: A Python library for sending HTTP requests to web servers.

Beautiful Soup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, facilitating web scraping tasks.

CSV: Data is exported to a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, ensuring compatibility and ease of use for further processing.

Outcome:

This web scraping project successfully retrieves valuable hotel data from Booking.com, providing insights into hotel offerings and facilitating informed decision-making for travelers or stakeholders in the hospitality industry.

Future Enhancements:

Data Enrichment: Implementing additional features to gather more detailed information about hotels, such as amenities, room types, and user reviews.

Automation: Integrating the web scraping script into a scheduled task or workflow to periodically update hotel data for analysis or visualization purposes.

Conclusion:

By leveraging web scraping techniques and Python libraries, this project demonstrates the capability to extract valuable data from online sources, offering insights and opportunities for decision-making in various domains, including travel and hospitality.
